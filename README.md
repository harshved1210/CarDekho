## 🧠 Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to develop a data science solution for accurately predicting used car prices.  
By analyzing a diverse dataset—including car model, number of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features, and location—we aim to build a machine learning model that provides current valuations for used cars.

## 🚀 Project Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Import  
- Import data from all Excel files representing different cities.  
- Combine datasets into a unified DataFrame for analysis.  

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration  
- Examine dataset structure.  
- Identify missing values, outliers, data types, and distributions.  
- Perform initial statistical analysis to understand relationships.  

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values appropriately.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Extract useful information like car age, mileage, and derived features.  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  
  - Apply techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.  
- **Normalization/Scaling:**  
  - Scale numerical features to ensure comparability.
